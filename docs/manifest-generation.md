### Options

#### -c Path to CF Manifest File
To specify the CF manifest and used to pull CF related properties into the generated Diego manifest

#### -x Opt out of deploying etcd with the database VMs
When fully migrated data from an etcd release to SQL, or a fresh install using SQL use the -x flag to not deploy etcd to the database VMs.

#### -g Opt into using garden-runc-release for cells

**Note**: Migration from garden-linux based cells to garden-runc cells is not supported.  Cells must be recreated if previously deployed using garden-linux.

#### -b Opt into using capi-release for bridge components
Use the cc-bridge components (e.g., stager, nsync, tps, etc.) from capi-release instead of cf-release.

### Stubs

#### IaaS settings stub file
The  file to specify the IaaS specific values.  Items such as the subnet-configs, stemcell specifications etc.

##### bosh-lite example:
The bosh-lite IaaS-settings example can be found [iaas-settings.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/blob/develop/manifest-generation/bosh-lite-stubs/iaas-settings.yml).

#### Property overrides stub file
The  file to override specific diego properties

##### Bosh-lite example:
The bosh-lite property-overrides example can be found [property-overrides.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/blob/develop/manifest-generation/bosh-lite-stubs/property-overrides.yml)

#### Instance count overrides stub file (optional)
The file is used override the instance count for jobs in the diego manifest

##### bosh-lite example:
The bosh-lite instance-count-overrides example can be found [instance-count-overrides.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/blob/develop/manifest-generation/bosh-lite-stubs/instance-count-overrides.yml)

#### Release versions override stub file (optional)
The file is used to override the default (latest) release version for the releases used in the manifest

##### Example:
```yaml
release-versions:
  etcd: 35
  cflinuxfs2-rootfs: 1.12.0
  garden-linux: 0.336.0
  diego: 1.1450.0
  garden-runc: 0.2.0
```

##### SQL stub file

The optional -s flag is used to specify the stub for SQL and needs to be specific to either MySQL or Postgres.

```yaml
sql_overrides:
  bbs:
    db_connection_string: 'diego:diego@tcp(10.244.7.2:3306)/diego'
    db_driver: mysql
    max_open_connections: 500
```

##### Postgres Example:
```yaml
sql_overrides:
  bbs:
    db_connection_string: 'postgres://diego:admin@10.244.0.30:5524/diego'
    db_driver: postgres
    max_open_connections: 500
```

##### **Experimental** Volume Stub File
